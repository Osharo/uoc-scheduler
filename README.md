# UOC Scheduler

***This is not an official repo from UOC (I'm a student)***

It shows a calendar using data from a json file (hardocded on a file) and remember what do you have to do on this
semester. Furthermore, this is a React Framework test to improve my skills.

_This application has a language mix inside_

## How works?

In the project directory, run: `npm start`

And then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
You can modify `database.json` as you want.

## Possible improvements
- Dynamic locale recognition, catching this info from user's browser
- Notes saved on localStorage
- Push notifications
